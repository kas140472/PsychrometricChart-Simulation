## INTRODUCTION<br>

A psychrometric chart is a complex graph that is used to assess the physical and thermodynamic properties of gas-vapour mixtures at constant pressure. It is often used to assess the properties of moist air.<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:<br>

1. Understand the various psychrometric properties that can be determined by the graph.

2. Portray the various psychometric properties on the graph.

3. Calculate the remaining psychrometric properties.

4. Infer the conditions of the moist air from the properties.



#### Theory<br>

A psychrometric chart is a complex graph that is used to assess the physical and thermodynamic properties of gas-vapour mixtures at constant pressure. It is often used to assess the properties of moist air.<br>

There are six important psychrometric properties that can be determined with the help of the chart:

1. Dry bulb temperature: A measure of air temperature recorded by a thermometer exposed to the air but shielded from moisture and radiation.<br>
2. Wet bulb temperature: The temperature recorded by a thermometer that has its bulb wrapped in cloth and moistened with distilled water.<br>
3. Relative humidity: The ratio of the actual vapour pressure relative to the vapour pressure of saturated air at the same temperature, expressed as a percentage.<br>
4. Dew point temperature: The highest temperature at which water vapour will condense.<br>
5. Humidity ratio: The dry-basis moisture content of air expressed as the weight of water vapour per unit weight of dry air.
6. Enthalpy: The energy content of the air.<br>

The properties determined by the psychrometric chart can be used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning applications among others.<br>

This experiment is a demonstration of how to read the psychrometric chart to determine the above six properties.

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The main objective of this lab is to demonstrate how to read the psychrometric chart to determine the six psychrometric properties: dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, relative humidity, dew point temperature, humidity ratio and enthalpy of an air-water mixture.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

A psychrometric chart is a complex graph that is used to assess the physical and thermodynamic properties of gas-vapour mixtures at constant pressure. It is often used to assess the properties of moist air.
<br><br>
There are six important psychrometric properties that can be determined with the help of the chart:
<br>
1. Dry bulb temperature: A measure of air temperature recorded by a thermometer exposed to the air but shielded from moisture and radiation.<br>
2. Wet bulb temperature: The temperature recorded by a thermometer that has its bulb wrapped in cloth and moistened with distilled water.<br>
3. Relative humidity: The ratio of the actual vapour pressure relative to the vapour pressure of saturated air at the same temperature, expressed as a percentage.<br>
4. Dew point temperature: The highest temperature at which water vapour will condense.<br>
5. Humidity ratio: The dry-basis moisture content of air expressed as the weight of water vapour per unit weight of dry air.<br>
6. Enthalpy: The energy content of the air.<br>

The properties determined by the psychrometric chart can be used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning applications among others.
<br>
This experiment is a demonstration of how to read the psychrometric chart to determine the above six properties.
